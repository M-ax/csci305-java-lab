1. To implement the last play feature, I added the instance variables lastPlay and lastPlayInternal to the Player
    abstract class.  When the play function is called, the lastPlayInternal variable gets assigned.  This is not
    accessible from outside the class, however, as when the round is happening, whichever player goes first would
    have their move exposed to the second player.  I combated this by adding another function, endRound(), that
    assigns the value of lastPlayInternal to lastPlay, which can then be seen by other classes using the getLastPlay()
    function.  This allows the opponent to see the move only on the next turn.

2. My bot works in much the same way as the LastPlayBot, but it instead chooses what would have beaten the opponent's
    last move, i.e. if the opponent played Rock last round, my bot will play Spock.  To implement this I used a switch
    statement in the play method that chooses a move that will beat the opponent's last.
